\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{CanSat Developement}

\subsubsection*{Mechanical design}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Mechanical design}

As part of our design process, we have been testing two different can designs in Autodesk Fusion. The first design, which we have used in previous years, features a lid at the bottom of the can. This design has proven to be reliable and effective, but it does have some limitations.

One advantage of the bottom-lid design is that it provides easy access to the interior of the can, making it simple to assemble and maintain. However, one disadvantage is that it requires a swivel to connect the parachute, which can add weight and complexity to the system. In addition, the bottom-lid design can make it difficult to swap out the parachute quickly and easily, which can be a significant time sink in the field.

The second design that we have been testing features a lid at the top of the can. This design allows for an interchange of the parachute without the need for a swivel, which can save weight and reduce complexity. It also offers improved accessibility, making it easier to access and maintain the interior of the can. However, one disadvantage is that it can be more difficult to assemble, as the components must be inserted through the top opening.

\subsubsection*{Electrical design}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Electrical design}


The team's experience gained from previous CanSat editions has proven to be extremely useful for this year's edition. After participating in last year's CanSat finals, the team has mastered and improved upon some of the technologies used, particularly on the technical side of the satellite.

The team began working on the fourth CanSat satellite in January and decided to program it in both C (Arduino) and Python (ESP32). This decision was made after extensive documentation and analysis of the previous editions.

Initially, the team switched from the LoPy used in the second CanSat to the new Raspberry Pi 2040 (the Pico). However, it was found that neither of these options satisfied the team's connection interface demands. To address this issue, the team decided to conduct extensive experimentation with the fourth design. As a result, the team is currently testing an interface with three microcontrollers and a lot of sensors, both for redundancy and testing new alternatives.

Our team recently embarked on a new project where we aimed to explore the interfacing of two ESP32 microcontrollers with an Arduino Nano 33 Ble Sense. The idea behind this decision was that the Arduino Nano 33 Ble Sense had already been thoroughly tested and had provided us with all the necessary parameters needed to accomplish our goals. However, we had previously used a camera module in conjunction with a Teensy board which had not been tested with an Arduino. Therefore, we wanted to experiment with a multi-microprocessor configuration for the next generation of CanSats.

In addition, some of our team members had participated in last year's Qube2Space competition organized by Students2Space and Politehnica Bucuresti. This experience had exposed us to new opportunities and allowed us to gain valuable knowledge about the field. As we are also involved in designing a PocketQube of 5x5x5 mm, the CanSat project presented us with the perfect opportunity to test new types of equipment.

We believe that the decision to combine the two types of microcontrollers was the perfect way to explore the full capabilities of our system. By using the Arduino Nano 33 Ble Sense, we were able to integrate our existing knowledge of the Arduino platform, while the ESP32 microcontrollers provided us with additional processing power and wireless capabilities. With this combination, we hoped to create a robust and versatile system that could meet our needs and objectives.

The components market is currently in high demand, and most of the old components used in previous CanSats are not easily accessible in the short term. Therefore, the team's extensive experimentation with the fourth design is critical to finding new solutions and alternatives that will be feasible for the current market.

Overall, the team's dedication to improving their technology and testing new solutions is commendable. With their vast experience and commitment to innovation, the team is sure to deliver a successful and advanced CanSat satellite in this year's competition.

In terms of acquiring the necessary components, most of them have been obtained from the suppliers and are already in the team's possession. This has allowed the team to move forward with the prototype testing of the CanSat subsystems, which is a critical step in the development process.

While some of the final circuit boards (PCBs) are still in transit from the supplier in China (JLCPCB), the team has continued to work diligently on other aspects of the project. In fact, team members have agreed to extend their allocated time on the project by working on many occasions from 20:00 to 22:00 on Saturdays. This commitment and dedication have helped the team to stay on track with the project timeline and make steady progress toward their goals.

\label{tab:sensors}

After extensive research and consideration, we have finalized the list of sensors that we want to integrate and test in our project. To ensure that these sensors operate smoothly and efficiently, we have created two I2C busses to handle their communication. By splitting the sensors between the two busses, we can avoid any potential conflicts between them and improve the overall performance of the system.

However, managing communication between multiple microcontrollers accessing shared resources, such as the flash memory, can be a challenge. To address this issue, we will implement a signal handler that will facilitate communication between the microcontrollers and ensure that they can access shared resources in a coordinated manner. This will help to minimize any potential conflicts and ensure that our sensors and other modules operate effectively and efficiently.

With this final list of sensors, our team is excited to move forward with integrating and testing our system. We are confident that with careful planning and implementation, we can create a powerful and reliable system that meets our needs and exceeds our expectations.

\subsubsection*{Recovery System}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Recovery System}
The choice of parachute for the team's first satellite was a hemispherical design. In 2019, the team conducted tests using hexagon and octagon parachutes, and with the help of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) attached to the can, the team was able to determine the descent speed of the satellite. Using this data, the team decided to proceed with the hexagonal model for their 2023 version of the satellite.

To further refine their parachute design, the team tested a modified version of the hexagonal parachute that was closer in design to the hemispherical one. The team relied on information gathered from online sources, such as \href{https://www.nakka-rocketry.net/paracon.html}{Nakka-Rocketry.net}, to build a model of the parachute and a new testing board with additional IMU and communication modules. Through these tests, we were able to achieve a descent velocity between 6 and 9  m/s, indicating a successful outcome.

In preparation for our upcoming mission, our team recognized the need to design and test new parachutes. We had been using the old parachutes for several missions, and they were starting to deteriorate, which could potentially compromise the success of our upcoming mission.

Therefore, we decided to create test parachutes until we could receive the required material from a supplier based in Germany. The new material we opted for was the Nylon Ripoff Cordura textile, which has a mass of 50 grams per square meter, and we sourced it from \href{https://www.extremtextil.de/}{extremtextil.de}.

The choice of material was crucial as it determines the durability and effectiveness of the parachute. The Nylon Ripoff Cordura textile is known for its high strength and abrasion resistance, making it ideal for use in harsh environments. We believe that this material will provide us with the reliability and durability we need for a successful mission.

As part of our  testing process, we designed and tested two parachutes that were specifically tailored for different weather conditions. The first parachute was smaller in size and intended for use in windy weather, while the second parachute was designed for calm weather conditions.

% The smaller parachute had a diameter of 35.6 cm and a surface area of 790.9 square centimeters, which is designed to slow down the descent speed to 9 meters per second. The design of this parachute was based on the principles of aerodynamics and is intended to withstand strong winds and turbulent weather conditions. We believe that this parachute will be instrumental in ensuring a safe and successful landing of our CanSat during windy weather conditions.

% The second parachute was designed for use during calm weather conditions and had a diameter of 26.7 cm and a surface area of 444.9 square centimeters, which is designed to slow down the descent speed to 6 meters per second. This parachute was optimized for stable and predictable conditions and is intended to provide a gentle and controlled descent of the CanSat during calm weather conditions.

\subsubsection*{Ground Support Equipment}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Ground Support Equipment}

In preparation for our upcoming mission, our team recognized the need to ensure that we have a reliable and efficient base station for our CanSat system. To achieve this, we decided to take a two-pronged approach to our base station development.

Firstly, we decided to reuse our old base station, which was based on LoPy from Pycom. This base station had been used in previous missions and had proven to be highly reliable and effective. We believed that this approach would provide us with a solid foundation for our base station system and ensure that we have a reliable backup in case of any unforeseen issues.

Secondly, we decided to design a new base station based on Raspberry Pico. This decision was based on our desire to explore new technologies and capabilities and to create a more advanced and sophisticated system that could meet our evolving needs. The Raspberry Pico offered us greater processing power, enhanced connectivity, and increased flexibility, which we believed would be instrumental in achieving our goals.

However, the progress of our new base station design has been put on hold due to delays in the delivery of our components from our manufacturer in China, JLCPCB. This has caused some frustration and has forced us to reassess our timelines and project schedules. However, we remain committed to this approach and believe that the benefits of the new base station design will outweigh the short-term setbacks we are currently experiencing.

\subsection*{Equipment testing}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Equipment testing}


Our team has made significant progress in testing the prototyped CanSat and sensors individually. We have conducted several specific tests on the sensors to ensure that they are functioning correctly, including pressure sensor tests, temperature sensor tests, humidity sensor tests, UV sensor tests, and GPS tests.

For the pressure sensor test, we exposed the used sensor to a pressure change and compared the results with a reference device. We placed both sensors in a sealed container with a known volume of air and measured the pressure change with a manometer or a barometer. The test was considered positive when both sensors showed the same pressure without measuring errors.

Similarly, for the temperature sensor test, we checked whether the target device and the reference device showed the same temperature within 24 hours. We placed both sensors in the same location and monitored their temperature readings at regular intervals for 24 hours. The test was considered positive when both sensors showed the same temperature without significant deviation.

For the humidity sensor test, we placed the target sensor and the reference device in a humidity chamber where the humidity was increased or decreased to a specific level, and the readings were compared. The target sensor and the reference device were placed in a humidity chamber where the humidity level was gradually increased or decreased to a specific level. The readings from both sensors were recorded and compared. The test was considered positive when both sensors showed the same humidity level without significant deviation.

Additionally, for the UV sensor test, we exposed the target sensor and the reference device to UV radiation from a UV light source and compared the readings. The target sensor and the reference device were exposed to UV radiation from a UV light source for a specific duration, and the readings were recorded and compared. The test was considered positive when both sensors showed the same UV index without significant deviation.

Moreover, we conducted a GPS test to test the accuracy of the GPS module by comparing the location obtained by the CanSat with the actual location. We recorded the location data collected by the GPS module during this time and compared it to the actual location using a separate reference system.


\subsection*{Project planning}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Project planning}

Our team is thrilled to report that we have made significant progress in the CanSat development process. We have successfully completed the initial prototyping phase, which allowed us to test the individual sensors and ensure that they are functioning correctly. In addition, we have conducted several rigorous tests on the CanSat's structure to verify its durability and endurance, and we are pleased to report that it has performed well under these challenging conditions.

With the necessary components and materials identified, we are now working tirelessly to integrate them into the final CanSat design. Our team is determined to deliver a high-quality product that meets our expectations and exceeds the competition requirements.

As we move forward, we recognize the importance of continuing our testing and refinement process to ensure that the CanSat performs to the best of its ability. To this end, we have scheduled the final PCB integration and testing phase for the last week before the launching campaign. This will allow us to thoroughly test the CanSat's electronics, ensuring that they are fully functional and performing optimally.

\subsection{Mission objectives}

{\textit{“Make life multiplanetary” - Elon Musk}}
\vspace{0.5cm}

The mission objective for the CanSat team is to conduct an atmospheric and landing site survey at an altitude of roughly 1000 meters. This survey aims to determine the feasibility of future missions for more in-depth exploration. During the flight, the CanSat will have two missions: one primary and one secondary.

During its flight, the CanSat will take pictures using the mounted camera to capture the terrain during the descent. The team plans to categorize the terrain in the photographs to gain a better understanding of the surrounding landscape. Additionally, the CanSat will continuously collect and send important data such as position, temperature, pressure, humidity, and UV index throughout its flight.

\subsubsection{Missions description}

The CanSat's \textbf{primary mission}, following its release and during its descent, is to measure air \textbf{temperature} and air \textbf{pressure}. It will transmit this data to the ground station at least once every second. The data collected will be analyzed using the barometric formula to determine the CanSat's altitude.

The secondary mission of the CoderDojo Space Robotics project extends beyond its primary objectives by measuring additional parameters, such as humidity, UV light, carbon dioxide, and particulate matter (PM), in addition to telemetry data, incorporating the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.27cm, itemindent=0cm, topsep=2pt, label=\faTasks]
    \item {\textbf{Atmospheric Science:}} The CanSat will measure and record atmospheric data at different altitudes, such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. The data collected will be used to study the atmosphere and create a visual representation of the atmospheric profile.
    \item {\textbf{UV Radiation Detection:}} The CanSat will detect and record the amount of UV radiation at different altitudes during its descent. This data will be used to create a profile of the UV radiation intensity along the descending path. This information will help identify areas with high levels of UV radiation and raise awareness of the risks of skin damage and other health problems.
    \item {\textbf{Air Pollution:}} The CanSat will measure and record air quality data at different altitudes, such as carbon monoxide and ozone levels. This data will be analyzed to identify sources of pollution and inform public policy decisions related to air quality.
    \item {\textbf{Mapping:}} The CanSat will be equipped with cameras and other sensors to collect data on land features from high altitudes. This information will be used to create detailed maps of the area.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Measurements, investigations and tests}

We will collect geolocation data that will be analyzed to determine the precise location of the CanSat and to create a map of the surrounding area. This information can be used to identify potential landing sites for future missions and to gain a better understanding of the environment. 

The CanSat software aims to create topographic maps using photographs taken during the mission. The application starts immediately after the launch and captures images, which will be classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN) to obtain terrain classifications. CNN is a type of neural network that uses special filters to reduce the number of parameters required to train the model. The development of the ML classifier and the transmission and reception of data are both major objectives of the mission and significant effort will be dedicated to their development.

Real-time transmission will be implemented for some of the measured data using a LoraWAN network, while the remaining data collected at a higher frequency will be stored on a flash memory and microSD card for post-retrieval analysis, if the recovery is possible. The sensor and camera data will be analyzed to reconstruct the descent trajectory and generate topographic representations of the surrounding environment during the descent phase.

To transform the collected data into a meaningful story, our team recognizes the importance of data analysis. We understand that this analysis is a crucial step after data collection from the satellite, and we will ensure that the information obtained is utilized effectively. We plan to use various methods to analyze the data collected from the CanSat. Depending on the data type, different tools will be required for analysis. The methods we will employ for analyzing sensor data include visual representation using charts and graphs, generation of tables for variable comparison, and performing calculations on numerical data.

Indeed, gathering atmospheric data for the CDOSR project is not only crucial for environmental reasons, but also for technical reasons. The CanSat will operate in a challenging and dynamic environment, with rapidly changing atmospheric conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and pressure.

Therefore, there are several additional reasons why the CDOSR team may have selected the secondary mission of measuring atmospheric data and air pollution at different altitudes.

One reason is to test new materials for the parachute, which is a critical component of the CanSat's descent system. The team may be using an extremely lightweight Cordura nylon material for the parachute to increase its effectiveness while reducing the satellite's overall weight. By measuring atmospheric data during the descent, the team can evaluate the parachute's performance and determine whether the new material is suitable for future missions.

Another reason may be to test a new microcontroller for the main board, which is responsible for controlling and coordinating the various systems on the CanSat. Gathering atmospheric data during the mission can help the team evaluate the microcontroller's performance in real-world conditions and identify any areas for improvement.

Moreover, the team may be exploring the feasibility of using a modular design for different types of sensors. By gathering atmospheric data and air pollution data, the team can evaluate the performance of various sensors and determine which ones are best suited for future missions. Additionally, the team may be exploring the possibility of using one microcontroller core to process images during the descent, which can reduce the weight and complexity of the CanSat's onboard systems.

\subsubsection{Research expectations}

The CDOSR team expects to gain several insights and knowledge from the secondary mission of measuring atmospheric data and air pollution at different altitudes.

The team's primary objective is to gain a better understanding of the atmospheric conditions and their impact on the CanSat's performance and operation. By precisely measuring various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and pressure at different altitudes, the team aims to optimize the design and operation of the CanSat's systems, ensuring its survival and successful mission completion.

As the altitude increases, the atmospheric conditions undergo significant changes. The team expects a decrease in temperature of around 6.5 °C per kilometer, which is approximately the value of the vertical thermal gradient in the troposphere under standard conditions\endnote{
    {\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\_temperature\#Temperature\_versus\_altitude}
    {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\_temperature}}}. Moreover, using both linear and exponential Stevin's law\endnote{
    {\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical\_pressure\_variation}
    {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical\_pressure\_variation}}}, 
the team should detect a decrease in air pressure of approximately 120 hPa per 1000 meters. As a consequence, there should be also a slight decrease in relative humidity since it is directly proportional to the air pressure. These insights will help the team to design and optimize the CanSat's systems to withstand the changing atmospheric conditions during the mission.

Secondly, the team hopes to gain insights into the levels of UV radiation and air pollution at different altitudes. By collecting and analyzing this data, the team can identify sources of pollution and raise awareness of the risks of skin damage and other health problems associated with high levels of UV radiation.

Moreover, the team hopes to gain insights into the data collection, transmission, and analysis process for future space-related projects. By equipping the CanSat with cameras and other sensors, the team can collect data on land features from high altitudes and create detailed maps of the area. This can inform urban planning, disaster management, and other applications.

Overall, the CoderDojo Space Robotics project team expects to gain valuable insights and knowledge from the secondary mission of measuring atmospheric data and air pollution at different altitudes, contributing to the broader goal of promoting environmental sustainability and advancing space-related technology.

In conclusion, the primary mission of the CanSat project is to measure and transmit atmospheric data such as temperature, pressure, and altitude, while the secondary mission includes additional measurements such as humidity, UV radiation, air pollution, and telemetry data. 

The importance of gathering atmospheric data for space-related projects cannot be overstated, as it provides crucial insights into the environmental conditions in which the project operates, optimizes its design, and contributes to broader sustainability efforts.

Understanding the atmospheric conditions is essential for the successful operation of any space-related project. The atmosphere plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of a satellite, such as its trajectory and orientation. Temperature, pressure, and humidity can affect the functioning of onboard electronics, while exposure to high levels of UV radiation can damage the satellite's surface and components.

By gathering atmospheric data at different altitudes, the team can gain a comprehensive understanding of the environment in which the CanSat will operate. This information can be used to optimize the satellite's design and operating procedures, ensuring its survival and successful completion of the mission. Moreover, the data collected can be compared with existing models of the Earth's atmosphere to improve their accuracy and reliability.

This data is stored on an SD card for later analysis, but it is also transmitted to the base station in real-time using the LoRa protocol.

In addition to collecting data from sensors, the boards also receive data from two GPS modules. This data is routed to the GSM communication module, which sends the GPS coordinates of the CanSat to the base station. This allows the mission team to track the CanSat's location and monitor its progress during the flight.

Overall, the combination of the ESP32 and Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense boards provides a reliable and efficient way to collect and transmit data during the CanSat's flight. The data collected can be analyzed after the mission to gain insights into various environmental factors and improve future missions.


\subsection{Mechanical/structural design}

For the mechanical design, several factors have been considered to ensure the CanSat's robustness and easy maintenance:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.75cm,itemindent=0cm, noitemsep, topsep=3pt,  label=\faCheck]
    \item \textbf{Component protection}: The CanSat's structure has been designed to protect the components from any external impact or shock during the launch and landing;
    \item \textbf{Resilient structure}: The CanSat's structure includes shock-absorbing systems such as foam or gel-based layers, springs, or a combination of both. These systems will help to reduce the impact force during landing, preventing damage to the CanSat and its components.;
    \item \textbf{Easy removal of batteries and radio transmitters}: The batteries and radio transmitters are positioned in a way that allows for easy removal in case of any malfunction or for recharging and testing purposes.;
    \item \textbf{Easy access to components}: The CanSat's body has been designed to allow easy extraction of the components for maintenance or replacement in case of malfunctions
    \item \textbf{Easy removal of batteries and radio transmitter}s: The batteries and radio transmitters are positioned in a way that allows for easy removal in case of any malfunction or for recharging and testing purposes.
\end{itemize}

By taking these factors into account, the team aims to create a robust and reliable CanSat that can withstand the harsh conditions of the mission and deliver accurate data.

The CanSat's structure is made from a combination of Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), two lightweight 3D printing materials that provide strength, durability, and exceptional design. This composition allows the can to withstand the stress of launch and landing while maintaining an aerodynamic shape. Additionally, the can is designed with a removable bottom section, providing easy access to its internal components. This allows for easy maintenance and repair of the can, without having to dismantle the entire structure.

Despite PLA's relatively low impact strength, the electronic components housed within the CanSat are protected by 3D-printed supports and foam. The high tensile strength of PLA, which is about 50 MPa, ensures that the 3D-printed parts remain intact when the parachute deploys, preventing disintegration.

The design of the can is also important to ensure its durability during the launch and landing process. It must withstand high levels of stress and force during these events, so the structure must be designed to distribute and absorb these forces. The can's aerodynamic design is also important for reducing air resistance and achieving maximum altitude during launch.

\caption{\small{CanSat main characteristics}}
\end{table}

The CanSat is composed of several major components, including four PCB boards that house all the necessary modules. The battery pack, which is the largest and heaviest component, is located at the bottom of the can and contains two 18650 battery modules placed in a vertical position. The camera module is situated in the bottom middle of the can, along with a Sensirion SPS-30 particulate matter dust sensor. The upper part of the can houses the PCB layers, interconnected with mezzanine connectors, which are fixed in place using screws and glue. Despite the relatively heavy weight of the battery pack, the can is designed to withstand the stress of launch and landing, and the components are secured in place with 3D-printed supports and foam to prevent damage.

In order to ensure the functionality of the CanSat system during multiple tests, mechanical solutions were explored to protect the can and its contents from the impact of landing. After analyzing various options for shock-absorbing systems, we settled on prototyping and testing the most promising ideas based on their effectiveness, feasibility, and cost. Three potential concepts were identified, including:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm,itemindent=0.5cm, noitemsep, topsep=0pt, label=$\bullet$]
    \item a foam or gel-based system;
    \item a spring-based system;
    \item a combined system using both foam or gel materials and springs.
\end{itemize}

The foam or gel-based system involves placing a layer of shock-absorbing foam or gel between two layers of the can, positioned at the bottom opposite to where the parachute is fastened. The spring-based system used a set of springs placed between two bottom layers of the can to compress and absorb the impact of the landing. Finally, the combined system used both springs and foam or gel materials to absorb the initial impact and further reduce the force of the landing, ultimately protecting the CanSat from damage.

The CanSat case is equipped with inserts along the inside to enhance its structural integrity. The lid is firmly secured using screws inserted into dedicated holes in the cap, ensuring that it cannot be opened without a screwdriver. Additionally, the case features strategically placed holes to allow for optimal camera positioning and airflow inside the can. 


\subsection{Electrical design}

The electrical design of our CanSat relies on the use of custom-made PCBs due to the limited space available in its interior. We have developed custom PCBs designed using Autodesk's EAGLE software to ensure that all the necessary components fit properly. 

Using custom PCBs provides several advantages for the CanSat project. Firstly, it allows for a better fit of all the components in the limited space available. This can increase the overall efficiency of the CanSat by reducing the size and weight of the PCBs while still accommodating all the necessary components. Secondly, custom PCBs can also help to reduce the risk of damage to the components during the launch and landing phases of the mission. By integrating the components into the PCB design, they are better protected from shocks and vibrations. Finally, designing custom PCBs allows for greater flexibility and customization in the CanSat's design, making it possible to optimize its performance and tailor it to specific mission requirements.

\subsubsection{Electrical Interface}
The electrical interface of the CanSat is designed to ensure a robust and reliable connection between its various electronic components. The main board serves as the central hub for the electrical interface, providing power and data connections to the sensors, transmitter, and other components.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/img_module_diagram.png}
\caption{\small{The Cansat block diagram with power and data lines.}}
\label{figmodule_diagrame}
\end{figure}

A small form factor size was chosen for the CanSat's mainboard and base station, consisting of an ESP32 Wroom module and an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board. These components provide the necessary computing power and wireless communication capabilities for the mission. To ensure compatibility and flexibility, multiple types of connections were implemented between the microprocessor and other parts, such as UART, I2C, SPI, Digital Inputs, and Outputs.

An ESP32 module with a camera is used for the video recording and streaming feature of the CanSat. This camera is separated from the rest of the CanSat and is powered by the Power board, a custom-designed PCB. The ESP32 camera and the main microcontroller (which is an ESP32, backed by an Arduino Nano 33) are also powered by the Power board. The sensors for environmental parameter measurement, such as atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity, are placed on the same PCB as the ESP32 to reduce data line connectivity through the use of I2C connections. All data collected by the sensors are logged on an SD card and flash memory and are transmitted to the base station.

\end{table}

The ESP32 and Arduino Nano 33 microcontrollers are powered by the 3.3 Volt line from the power board, while certain components, such as the GSM module, require a higher 5 Volt line. The voltage range of the 18650-battery pack used to power the CanSat is within a safe range of 3.6V - 4.2V. To ensure that the batteries are used within this safe range, two buck-boost converters are employed to step down the voltage to 3.3V and up to 5V. These converters are capable of delivering up to 2A of continuous current, which provides enough power to run all the CanSat components without any risk of damaging them.

We can estimate the time that the CanSat can be powered using the following formula:

\begin{equation*}
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Battery capacity} * \text{Voltage}}{\text{Power consumption}}=\frac{\SI{6800}{\milli\ampere} * \SI{4.2}{\volt}}{\SI{15.2}{\watt}} = \SI{1}{\hour}52\text{min}
\end{equation*}

The duration of 1 hour and 52 minutes is applicable when the CanSat's electronics operate at full capacity. However, since SMS messages are transmitted only twice per minute and some sensors go offline after landing, this operational time significantly extends to well over 3 hours.

\subsubsection{Power budget}

The CanSat is powered by a rechargeable dual lithium-ion chemistry 18650-battery pack with a 3.6 Volt output, supplying power to all of the components, with a maximum discharge of 8A. With an estimated power consumption of approximately 450mA, the battery pack's 6800mAh capacity provides ample power for the entire mission. To ensure the CanSat has sufficient power throughout the mission, the battery is designed to provide over 4 hours of power supply to the system, even in the most power-consuming conditions. Moreover, after landing, the CanSat is programmed to switch to a lower power consumption mode, allowing for an extended battery life.

\subsubsection{RF Link}
The RF link is an essential component of any CanSat mission. It allows for real-time data transmission from the CanSat to the ground station, enabling the team to monitor the CanSat's performance and collect valuable data during the flight.

In our CanSat, we are using two different RF modules to ensure reliable and redundant communication. The primary module is the RN2483 from Microchip, which is responsible for sending data to the base station with parameters such as GPS coordinates, temperature, pressure, altitude, and gas sensor data. This module communicates with the ESP32 microcontroller on UART protocol and operates on a 3.3V supply with a current consumption of around 100-150mA. The RN2483 operates on a frequency of 868MHz with a data rate of up to 9.6Kbps and a sensitivity of around -121dBm.

In addition to the primary RF module, we are also using the SIM800L miniature cellular module as a secondary telemetry system. This module will send GPS coordinates, temperature, pressure, and altitude data to the base station, allows for GPRS transmission and sending SMS, and will transmit most of our monitored parameters to the ground station. The SIM800L operates on a 5V supply with a current consumption of 150mA, but the module can spike up to 2000mA when sending SMS. 

By using two different RF modules, we are able to ensure reliable communication between the CanSat and the ground station, even in the event of a failure or interference with one of the modules. This redundancy is crucial for a successful mission and allows us to collect the data we need to achieve our goals.


\subsection{Software design}

The CanSat’s software has two main purposes. Firstly, it is designed to acquire and log data from various sensors. This includes communication with the hardware equipment and additional processing such as compensation, data manipulation, and various calculations to give the raw data some meaning. Secondly, the software is responsible for logging the acquired data onto onboard persistent storage and transmitting it to the ground station. The software is programmed to execute all of these tasks autonomously, in real-time with a high-speed performance, without the need for human intervention. The CanSat software has two main parts: initialization and operating mode. 

\subsubsection{Boot-up sequence}
During the initialization phase (boot-up), the system initializes by setting up various parameters and values to ensure proper functioning, and the software sets up the connected hardware, including sensors and data transmission devices, following a static set of instructions. Once the devices are set up, a startup message is sent on the data transmission channel to indicate that the system is online, and any errors encountered during this phase are logged.

\subsubsection{Runtime and data management}
After the initialization phase, the program enters the main loop, where it reads each sensor at a predefined period and processes the information. This loop spans almost the entire duration of the mission. Once the CanSat lands, the main loop is stopped, and the recovery loop starts. During this loop, only positional data is read, logged, or transmitted, and the recovery helper system is activated.

\subsubsection{Sensor interrogation}
The CanSat will collect various data from the sensors, with sensors being fetched every 150ms-250ms to maximize raw data throughput. Communication with the sensors is possible through the communication protocols described in section 2.3. To streamline the process and minimize time lost on switching between devices, each sensor is placed on its own dedicated bus utilizing the multiple SPI, I2C, and UART lanes/buses available on our microcontroller of choice.

\end{tabular}
\caption{\small{Data interfaces used in CanSat with their corresponding components.}}
\label{tab:data-interfaces}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Data Gathering and Storage}

To avoid data loss, logging will happen on both memory types. Flash memory will be used for continuous logging, while the SD card will be used as a backup. Data is going to be written in CSV format, including the timestamp for each reading, making it easy to process later. In addition to logging, data will also be transmitted via the RF link and the GSM module, providing real-time monitoring of the CanSat's data.

The data gathered includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item X, Y, and Z-axis readings from a gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer (only logged);
\item Temperature readings (in Celsius) from the temperature sensor (transmitted and logged);
\item Barometric pressure readings (in Pascals) and relative humidity readings (in percentage) from the BME280 sensor (transmitted and logged);
\item UV Index readings (transmitted and logged);
\item Altitude readings (in meters) calculated from the barometric pressure sensor (transmitted and logged);
\item Images captured by the onboard camera and saved locally;
\item Main battery voltage readings (in volts) (transmitted).
\end{itemize}

Both the flash memory and the SD-Card have sufficient capacity for storing the collected data and images. The ESP32 sends the data to the ground station in binary form, which ensures data security by encrypting the packages before transmitting them. The size of the data packets is small, so a stable connection ensures no issues with data transfer. Even if the data is transmitted every second, the total amount of data transferred does not exceed 1 Mb.

\subsubsection{Programming Language and Development Environment}

The ESP32 microcontroller is the central component of the CanSat, responsible for managing all the peripherals connected through various media access and wire protocols. Each device requires specific commands and data retrieval procedures. Furthermore, every operation involving an external device must adhere to strict time constraints. For instance, a query to the temperature sensor must be processed before the next packet is sent across the wireless link to the ground station.


To ensure that these strict timing requirements are met, the CanSat firmware is based on a real-time operating system (RTOS). RTOS is ideal for mission-critical applications where I/O calls and system calls must be executed within a specific timeframe, and where errors must not cause the system to stop running. The ESP32's official software development kit comes with FreeRTOS, which is the open-source de-facto standard for embedded applications.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=12.7cm]{images/img_Code_Blocks.png}
    \caption{\small{Software diagram.}}
    \label{fig:codeblocks}
\end{figure}


The ESP32 microcontroller will be programmed using the C programming language and the official Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF). To manage the SDK, the framework, and all the required tools, such as the compiler, we will be using PlatformIO for Visual Studio Code. This provides a user-friendly interface for managing the build process, and also allows us to integrate with other development tools such as Git for code versioning.

We will be using GIT extensively to keep track of changes to the codebase. Every time a new functionality is added to the code, Git takes a snapshot of the entire codebase. This allows us to easily roll back to a previous version if a new feature breaks the code. With Git, we can collaborate on the codebase and track changes made by different team members, ensuring a smooth and efficient development process.

    \includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{images/img_Cansat_RTOS.eps}
    \caption{\small{CanSat software state diagram.}}
    \label{fig:rtos}
\end{wrapfigure}



Additionally, we are planning to develop a custom software application that will run on the ground station. This application will receive the telemetry data from the CanSat and interpret it, visualizing the information on real-time graphs. The software will extract sensor data such as acceleration, GPS coordinates, pressure, and more from the raw data packets, allowing us to monitor the CanSat's performance and the environmental conditions it encounters. The software will also log the data to ensure that no valuable measurements are lost. This custom software will provide a vital tool for our team to monitor and analyze the CanSat's data during the mission.

\subsection{Recovery system}
Recovering the satellite is essential as extended mission data and video data are stored on the
CanSat. To ensure the safe and efficient recovery of the CanSat, a total of four systems were designed and implemented. 

Firstly, a parachute system was incorporated to slow down the descent rate and ensure a soft landing. Secondly, a radio beacon and buzzer were included to aid in locating the CanSat once it landed. Thirdly, a GSM messaging system was added to transmit the GPS coordinates to the recovery team. This allows for the rapid location and retrieval of the CanSat after landing. Overall, these four systems work in conjunction to ensure a successful and safe recovery mission.

\subsubsection{Parachute}
The parachute system was designed to slow down the descent rate of the CanSat to a safe and controlled speed, depending on weather conditions. To ensure the success of the recovery process, the design of the parachute system considers both the need for a longer flight time to conduct accurate atmospheric analysis during the descent phase in good weather conditions, as well as the need for a fast descent in case of bad weather conditions. It is worth noting that the calculations used to determine the descent rate also take into account the time factor, which is crucial for a successful recovery.

The hemispherical parachute with an additional spill hole of diameter $d=20\%$ of the canopy's diameter, $D$, on the top is our preferred primary recovery system due to its high drag coefficient per area, which allows for a lightweight parachute. This spill hole helps with air transition along the parachute, preventing CanSat oscillations during descent. Additionally, this parachute has been used in previous competitions with good results. 

Upon release from the rocket/airplane/helicopter, the parachute will immediately deploy to slow the CanSat's descent through the atmosphere. To stabilize the rotation of the CanSat during descent and obtain better camera images, the parachute will be connected to the can in six points using a lightweight rope weighing only 1 gram/meter.

It is recommended to connect canopy lines to the CanSat using a ball-bearing swivel. This will help prevent line entanglement during deployment and descent. Additionally, the length of the canopy lines should be 20\% longer than the radius of the canopy to prevent the lines from tangling during descent.

To account for different weather conditions, we have prepared three different parachutes. The first is designed for high-speed descent in bad weather conditions, allowing for a descent speed of 11-12 m/s. The second parachute is suitable for normal conditions, with a descent speed range of 7-10 m/s. The third parachute is intended for clear sky and no wind conditions, resulting in a descent speed of 5-6 m/s.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.26\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=4cm]{images/img_canopy2.eps}
    \caption{\small{Parachute design.}}
    \label{fig:software_fiagram}
\end{wrapfigure}

As we know, a falling object in a fluid (the atmosphere) is subject to two main forces:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm,itemindent=0.5cm,noitemsep, topsep=4pt, label=$\bullet$]
    \item Weight $W = m \cdot g$ where $m = 0.3\text{ kg}$ and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration
    \item Friction $F_f = -k \cdot v^2$ where $k$ is the air friction coefficient ($\displaystyle k = \frac{\rho C_D A}{2}$) and $v$ is the velocity of the CanSat. Here, $\rho$ is the density of air, $C_D$ is the drag coefficient, $A$ is the parachute's area, and $v$ is the velocity in meters per second (m/s).
\end{itemize}

The resulting force on the CanSat is given by:
\begin{equation*}
F = W + F_f = mg - kv^2
\end{equation*}
Hence, we can obtain the expression for the terminal velocity, and consequently, the formula for the parachute's area, which leads to the equation for the diameter, D, of the canopy:
\begin{equation*}
v = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho C_D A}},\quad\quad A=\frac{2mg}{C_D \rho v^2}, \quad\quad D = \sqrt{\frac{8A}{n \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)}}
\end{equation*}


To calculate the dimensions required for the parachute, we considered the following constant parameters, including physical constants and canopy parameters.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Constant parameters and their values}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Buzzer and GSM Messaging}
We have implemented two secondary recovery systems for the CanSat, to ensure its safe retrieval on the ground. The first system comprises two types of live telemetry, namely GSM and RF. This system transmits important data such as GPS coordinates, heading information from multiple sensors, and descent speed. The second recovery system is designed to aid in the precise localization of the CanSat using audio signals, which include a loud buzzer and a ribbon attached to the CanSat. This system is activated immediately after landing.

\subsection{Ground support equipment}
The ground segment software is a critical component that receives and processes data sent from the CanSat. This software is responsible for collecting, storing, and presenting the data in a user-friendly format. In addition, it provides advanced functionality for analyzing and visualizing the data, enabling the team to extract valuable insights and make informed decisions.

Our ground support equipment comprises receiver equipment and data visualization/logging components. The receiver equipment captures radio signals and telemetry data transmitted by the CanSat, and to ensure the best data quality, the receiver antennas will be mounted at a height of 2-3 meters above ground level. For ease of interpretation of the received data, we will be using multiple devices, including one or two omnidirectional antennas, a cell phone for SMS, and a laptop for RF telemetry with real-time graphs and data logging capabilities.

To ensure minimal packet loss, we have included an omnidirectional Moxon antenna and a 1/4 Wave Ground Plane Antenna in our ground station setup. These antennas will be linked to the ground stations and have the capability to maintain a strong signal even at a maximum distance of 1000 meters.

The CanSat LoRa and the ground station will operate on a frequency of 868.1 MHz, which is a free frequency band available for unlicensed use in many countries. This frequency band offers good propagation characteristics and is well-suited for long-range communication, making it a popular choice for IoT and other wireless applications.

To ensure that the software is able to capture all relevant data, it is designed to work seamlessly with the radio receiver. It processes the data in real-time, which means that the team can monitor the CanSat's progress and take action if necessary. Furthermore, the software is optimized for efficiency and reliability, ensuring that the data is stored safely and accurately.

The data received from the CanSat is stored in a file format that is easily readable and processable. To achieve this, we are using the CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, which allows for easy integration with various data analysis software tools. The CSV format also ensures that the data is organized and structured for efficient processing and analysis.

One of the key features of the software is its ability to present data in a user-friendly format. It provides clear, concise visualizations that allow the team to quickly identify trends and patterns in the data. This is crucial for making informed decisions and optimizing the CanSat's performance.

In addition to visualizing data, the software also provides advanced functionality for analyzing and processing data. This enables the team to extract valuable insights from the data, such as identifying areas for improvement or optimizing performance. The software also supports data logging, which ensures that all data is stored securely and can be accessed at a later time if necessary.

Overall, the ground segment software is an essential component that enables the team to maximize the performance of the CanSat. Its real-time data processing, clear visualizations, and advanced functionality make it a powerful tool for optimizing the CanSat's performance and achieving the mission's objectives.


\section{Project planning}
Effective project planning is essential for the successful design and construction of our proposed CanSat. From the outset, our team established a series of milestones that must be achieved during the competition phases. Accomplishing these milestones requires specific tasks, such as acquiring financial resources, identifying the most suitable materials, selecting high-performance sensors, and sourcing electronic components. Therefore, through discussions and careful planning, we have established a comprehensive plan to ensure the success of our CanSat project.

Our timeline takes into account every aspect of the project, including report writing, design, construction, launch, and testing. We have carefully allocated the necessary time and resources to each stage of the project to ensure that we meet our deadlines and achieve our goals. Regular progress checks will be conducted to ensure that we stay on track and make any necessary adjustments to our plan.

In addition to our internal timeline, we have also taken into consideration external factors, such as competition deadlines and launch availability, to ensure that we meet all necessary requirements and complete the project within the given timeframe.

By following our comprehensive timeline and adhering to our milestones, we are confident that we will successfully design, build, launch, and test our CanSat project.

\subsubsection{Budget}

We conducted thorough research to ensure that our budget aligns with the ideal specifications for our CanSat. This involved finding the most efficient and lightweight components without compromising performance, as well as maximizing battery life. By carefully considering each part, we aimed to optimize our budget and ensure that we could achieve our project objectives.

However, building the CanSat is just a part of the project. Therefore, our budget covers the entire project from start to finish, which can be divided into four main parts: 
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm, itemindent=0.25cm, noitemsep, topsep=0pt, label=$\bullet$]
    \item \textbf{Hardware parts}: all the necessary mechanical and electronic/electrical parts required to build both our custom development board and final CanSat. The cost estimation includes the purchase of a microcontroller, sensors, batteries, antennas, radio modules, lightweight printable plastics, and other miscellaneous parts.
    \item \textbf{Publicity and Branding}: covers the creation of custom t-shirts to promote our team and the event. In addition to custom t-shirts, we will also invest in creating promotional materials such as flyers, posters, and banners that showcase our team and the CanSat mission. These materials will be distributed both digitally and in person to help increase awareness of our project and the competition. Additionally, we will allocate a portion of our budget towards branding efforts such as website design and social media management to maintain a consistent and professional image for our team. Investing in Publicity and Branding will help us build a strong reputation within the community and attract potential sponsors and supporters to our cause.
    \item \textbf{Travel Expenses}: includes the transportation costs, with tickets for the team to travel to the Competition Venue. This includes the cost of transportation by train, as well as any necessary local travel expenses.
    \item \textbf{Emergency Funds}: a contingency budget to cover any unforeseen costs that may arise during the project.
\end{itemize}

Below is a table that outlines all the anticipated expenses associated with the CanSat mission. This includes the costs of the components used to construct the CanSat, as well as any supplementary materials, equipment, and personnel necessary to complete the mission.

The components required for the project were purchased from various suppliers such as Amazon, Mouser, TME, Adafruit, and JLCPCB. It is worth noting that the team did not receive Cansat kits, and as a result, the team members did all the design and construction of the CanSat.

The project has been divided into several phases, with each phase having a specific duration and tasks to be accomplished.

The ideation phase has already been completed, and we are currently in the design and prototyping stages of the CanSat, with the remaining phases including various testing campaigns and construction runs. The exact details of the testing phase are yet to be defined and will be determined as the project progresses. The final phase will culminate in the competition. By using this tool, we can monitor progress, adjust timelines, and stay on schedule to achieve the desired outcomes

We estimate a total of 630 man-hours needed for the entire project, and we have already invested 330 hours towards it. The Gantt chart automatically updates as we progress through the project, allowing us to monitor our progress and adjust our plans as necessary to ensure the timely completion of the project.

We have started testing Jira in parallel with using TeamGantt.com to implement an Agile framework for future competitions. Jira is a project management software that provides a flexible and powerful platform for managing projects using an Agile framework. 

By implementing Jira, we can create a central location for tracking tasks, issues, and progress throughout the project lifecycle. This will allow us to easily collaborate and communicate with team members and stakeholders, as well as prioritize tasks and adjust schedules based on changing requirements or circumstances. In addition, Jira offers a range of reporting and analytics features, providing valuable insights into team performance, task completion rates, and potential bottlenecks. With Jira, we can also track time and effort spent on each task, which will help us better estimate future efforts and improve our planning and scheduling for future competitions. By using both Jira and TeamGantt.com, we can optimize our project management process and ensure efficient, effective completion of the CanSat project.

\section{Data Analysis and Outreach}
The data collected during the CanSat mission holds a wealth of information that can provide valuable insights into various aspects of the mission. Data analysis is, therefore, a crucial step in making sense of the collected data, drawing meaningful insights, and making informed decisions. In addition to analyzing the data for internal use, outreach is another important aspect of the data analysis process. Through outreach, the findings of the analysis can be shared with a wider audience, including stakeholders, the scientific community, and the public. In this section, we will discuss the data analysis and outreach efforts of the CanSat mission, highlighting the various tools and strategies used to analyze and disseminate the collected data.

\subsection{Data Analysis Plan}

The CanSat data plan is a comprehensive approach to collecting, processing and analyzing the data generated by the CanSat mission. The plan leverages various Python libraries to ensure that the data is acquired, processed, and visualized effectively. The six components of the data plan are Data acquisition, Data processing, Data visualization, Visual data processing, Pre-trainer software, and Statistical analysis.


\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm,itemindent=0.5cm, noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Data acquisition}: The data acquisition component of the plan utilizes a Python library to collect and store data from the CanSat sensors in real time. The library is designed to be compatible with the sensors used on the CanSat and is used to record data during the flight.
    \item \textbf{Data processing}: The data processing component of the plan involves a Python library that processes and cleans the raw data collected by the data acquisition software. The library is used to filter out any noise or errors in the data and organize it into a format suitable for analysis. To achieve the mission objectives, a range of statistical techniques and models, such as Stratonovich–Kalman–Bucy\endnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman\_filter}} filtering algorithms, will be employed to filter out noise and errors in the data. This will ensure that the data is accurate and reliable for further analysis.
    \item \textbf{Data visualization}: The data visualization component of the plan employs Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the data, such as easy-to-understand graphs and charts. These visualizations can help to quickly understand the data and identify patterns or trends.
    \item \textbf{Visual data processing}: This component of the plan is intended to analyze the images stored on the board of the CanSat using a pre-trained AI model. The model is developed using Python libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. This component can aid in identifying the presence of geological features such as valleys, mountains, forests, and volcanoes, as well as potential signs of water or ice on the surface of a planet.
    \item \textbf{Pre-trainer software}: The pre-trainer software is an essential tool for developing accurate and effective AI models for visual data processing. The pre-trainer utilizes Python libraries such as Scikit-learn and PyTorch to collect photos, classify them into desired categories, and use them for training the AI model.
    \item \textbf{Statistical analysis}: The statistical analysis component of the plan uses Python libraries such as Pandas and Scipy to perform statistical analyses on the data. The library is used to identify any significant relationships or patterns in the data, such as the relationship between pressure and altitude. Statistical analysis is an essential tool for identifying trends and patterns in the data and drawing meaningful insights.
\end{itemize}

In addition to the software and tools used, the data analysis plan also outlines potential challenges and limitations that may arise during the analysis process. One such challenge is the need to account for external factors, such as atmospheric conditions, that may affect the accuracy of the data.

Another critical aspect of the data analysis plan is the documentation of the process to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The plan includes detailed descriptions of each step of the analysis process, including the software and tools used, any models or statistical techniques applied, and any assumptions or limitations of the analysis.

The use of statistical techniques and models, as well as powerful Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization, will enable the mission team to draw meaningful insights from the data and make informed decisions.
