\section{Data Analysis and Outreach}
There is a lot of useful information in the mission data that can provide valuable insights into various aspects of the mission. As a result, data analysis is an important step in making sense of the data that has been gathered, drawing useful conclusions, and making informed decisions. Outreach is an important part of the data analysis process, in addition to looking at the data for internal use. The analysis's results can be shared with more people, such as partners, the scientific community, and the public, through outreach. In this part, we'll talk about our data analysis and outreach efforts, focusing on the different tools and methods we used to look at the data and get the word out.
