\section{Conclusion}

While we are confident in the project's success, time constraints remain a challenge, forcing us to prioritize testing each module and the system as a whole. Based on the test results, we'll need to adjust our design for the final version of the CanSat.

We are aware of the considerable number of work hours needed to implement and test all the desired features, but we're making good progress. If we maintain our current pace, we believe the project will succeed, and we'll achieve our goal of winning the competition.
