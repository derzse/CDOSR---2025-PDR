\section{Conclusion}

While we are confident in the success of the project, time constraints are currently a challenge that requires us to focus on testing each module and the system as a whole. Based on the results of our tests, we will need to adjust our design for the final version of the CanSat. 

We are mindful of the significant number of work hours required to implement and test all the features we want, but we are making good progress, and if we continue at our current pace, we believe that the project will be successful, and we will achieve our goal of winning the competition.
