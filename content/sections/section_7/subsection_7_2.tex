\subsection{Recommendations for next steps}
Our next critical step is constructing the prototype board and conducting comprehensive testing on all modules, including RF communication, range, autonomy, telemetry data integrity, code, mechanics, g-force, and mission simulations. Other tasks include expanding the PDR document, conducting After Action Reviews (AAR), ensuring correct tests and sensor calibration, mechanical testing and design optimisation, improving LaTeX skills for technical reporting, allowing time for review and iterative improvements, scheduling team meetings, updating the project plan, seeking expert feedback, and remaining adaptable to achieve project goals.
