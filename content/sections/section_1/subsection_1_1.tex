\subsection{Purpose of the mission}

Our CanSat mission aims to perform multi-sensor integration for atmospheric and bioaerosol analysis, studying atmospheric conditions and the distribution of airborne particles at different altitudes. Using various sensors, we will collect data on pressure, temperature, humidity, and GPS coordinates during descent, while also gathering air samples for both onsite and subsequent laboratory analysis.

This project enhances our engineering and analytical skills, deepens our understanding of atmospheric microbiome transport, and contributes to environmental and space sciences. By fitting a small CanSat with various sensors and an air sampling system, we are testing new ways to improve satellite technology, environmental monitoring, and scientific research, supporting both the scientific community and our team's growth.
