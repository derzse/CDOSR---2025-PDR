\subsection{Purpose of the mission}

Our CanSat mission aims to perform Multi-sensor Integration for Atmospheric and Motion Analysis to study the atmosphere and cosmic ray interactions. Using various sensors, we'll gather data on pressure, temperature, humidity, UV light intensity, and carbon monoxide or dioxide levels, as well as detect muons. This project enhances our engineering and analytical skills, deepens our understanding of environmental and space sciences, and addresses issues like environmental degradation and air quality. By integrating different sensors on a small CanSat, we advance satellite technology, data analysis, and scientific research, contributing to both the scientific community and our team's growth.
