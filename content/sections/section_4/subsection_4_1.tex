Successful project planning is crucial for the effective design and construction of our proposed mission. From the beginning, our team defined key milestones to be achieved throughout the competition phases. Reaching these milestones involves critical tasks such as securing financial resources, selecting optimal materials, choosing high-performance sensors, and procuring electronic components. Through thorough discussions and strategic planning, we have developed a comprehensive roadmap to ensure the project's success.

Our timeline encompasses all aspects of the project, including report writing, design, construction, launch, and testing. We have strategically allocated time and resources to each phase to meet deadlines and achieve our objectives. Regular progress assessments will be conducted to keep the project on track and make any necessary adjustments to the plan.

Beyond our internal timeline, we have also accounted for external factors, including competition deadlines and launch availability, to ensure compliance with all requirements and timely project completion.

By following our comprehensive timeline and adhering to our milestones, we are confident that we will successfully design, build, launch, and test our CanSat project.
